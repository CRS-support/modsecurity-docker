## What is ModSecurity

ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform Web Application Firewall (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. It has a robust event-based programming language which provides protection from a range of attacks against web applications and allows for HTTP traffic monitoring, logging and real-time analysis.

## How to use this image

This image only contains ModSecurity built from the code provided on the [ModSecurity Github Repo](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity). **THE CORE RULE SET IS NOT PROVIDED IN THIS IMAGE**, but it should not be hard to extend. On the other hand, **IF YOU WANT MODSECURITY WITH THE CORE RULE SET please visit the [OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) DockerHub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/modsecurity-crs/)**.

1. Create a Dockerfile in your project and copy your code into container.

   ```
   FROM modsecurity:2-apache
   COPY ./public-html/ .
   ```

2. run the commands to build and run the Docker image.
   ```
   $ docker build -t my-modsec .
   $ docker run -p 8080:80 my-modsec
   ```

3. Visit http://localhost:8080 and your page.

### TLS/HTTPS

If you want to run your web traffic over TLS you can simply set the SETTLS argument to true when using Docker build. Note: This will use self signed certificates, to use your own certificates (recommended) COPY or mount (-v) your server.crt and server.key into /usr/local/apache2/conf/. Please remember you'll need to forward the HTTPS port

```
$docker build  --build-arg SETTLS=True -t my-modsec .
$docker run -p 8443:443 my-modsec
```

### Proxying

ModSecurity is often used as a reverse proxy. This allows one to use ModSecurity without modifying the webserver hosting the underlying application (and also protect web servers that modsecurity cannot currently embedd into). To set proxying one must set SETPROXY to True and provide the location of the Proxy via the PROXYLOCATION argument. Note: if you are going to be proxying to a HTTPS site, you'll need to set SETTLS to true also.

```
$docker build --build-arg SETPROXY=True --build-arg PROXYLOCATION=http://example.com -t my-modsec .
$ docker run -p 8080:80 my-modsec
```

### ServerName

It is often convenient to set your servername. to do this simply use the SERVERNAME Argument passed to docker build. By default the servername provided is localhost.
```
$ docker build --build-arg SERVERNAME=myhost -t modsec .
$ docker run -p 8080:80 my-modsec
```

## Image Variants

**Please pay attention!**
ModSecurity works across numerous different operating systems and webservers, as a result our images are tagged a bit different than what you might be typically encounter on other DockerHub repos. If the images are built on top of the images provided by the maintainers of the webserver (NGINX, Apache, etc), then they will be notated as simply as <version>-<webserver>. However, in many cases we understand that this is not sufficient for production deploys. As a result we also provide Ubuntu images. these will be in the form <version>-<webserver>-ubuntu.

* owasp/modsecurity:

   This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your rules and webapp then start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. These will always be built on top of the images provided by the webserver developers on DockerHub. The owasp/modsecurity:latest will use 3.x which is will use the NGINX provided image (https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) as a base.

* owasp/modsecurity:-nginx{-<x>}

   This image uses NGINX as its underlying webserver.

* owasp/modsecurity:-apache{-<x>}

   This image uses Apache as its underlying webserver.

* owasp/modsecurity:-<x>-ubuntu

   This image will use an ubuntu image provided by the Ubuntu DockerHub repo as its a base OS (https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).
